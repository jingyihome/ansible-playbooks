### Bookkeeping
I did the following bookkeeping:
 - [ ] If a major change, bumped the playbook version in `vars/`
 - [ ] Added as much documentation as I could (we're not looking a book, just enough to help others)
 - [ ] Confirmed that the PR works by running the vagrant tests (if any) and/or added to the tests (see `ci/` or legacy `tests/`)
 - [ ] Followed up with any automated test results as a result of the pull request
